Usage: -XX:FlightRecorderOptions=old-object-queue-size[=size]

The JFR old object sample sample queue is initialized with a fixed-size array at runtime.
The default size is 256 elements, but this can be configured at runtime using this option.
For example:

  -XX:FlightRecorderOptions=old-object-queue-size=1024
