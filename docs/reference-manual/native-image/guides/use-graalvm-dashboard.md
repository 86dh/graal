link_title: Use GraalVM Dashboard to Optimize the Size of a Native Executable
permalink: /reference-manual/native-image/guides/use-graalvm-dashboard/
---

GraalVM Dashboard was removed in GraalVM for JDK 22.
Instead, use the [Native Image Build Report tool](../PGO-Build-Report.md). 
The tool can generate a comprehensive report about your native executable and the build process itself with the visualization, and is  useful for exploring how different methods contribute to overall execution time.
