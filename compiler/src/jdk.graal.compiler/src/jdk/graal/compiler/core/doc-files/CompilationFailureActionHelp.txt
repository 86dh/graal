Specifies the action to take when compilation fails.

The accepted values are:
    Silent  - Prints nothing to the console.
     Print  - Prints the stack trace to the console.
  Diagnose* - Retries the compilation with extra diagnostics.
    ExitVM  - Same as Diagnose except that the VM process exits after retrying.
    
* If the value is "Diagnose", compilation is retried with extra diagnostics enabled including dumping.
  In such a scenario, the DiagnoseDumpLevel and DiagnoseLogLevel options specify respectively the dump and log level accordingly.
  The debug log will be redirected to a file named "retry.log", stored in the dump directory specified by the DumpPath option.
